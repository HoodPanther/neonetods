---generic code for checking if all species listed in the species list are in the taxonomy tables: 


---first check to see  how many distinct species are in the species list write down this number so you have a reference point for checking if all of your species are included in the taxonomy tables.

SELECT DISTINCT plants.spp_id
FROM species_lists.plants;	

---second: temporarily change the name of the taxonomy table you are working with so that sql can distinguish between the species list and the taxonomy table.

ALTER TABLE taxonomy.plants
RENAME TO plants_tax;

---third: join the species list and corresponding taxonomy table on spp_id and see how many results the query returns

SELECT DISTINCT plants.spp_id, plants_tax.spp_id
FROM species_lists.plants INNER JOIN taxonomy.plants_tax
ON plants.spp_id = plants_tax.spp_id
WHERE plants_tax.spp_id = plants.spp_id;

--If the query above does not return the same number of records as the first SELECT DISTINCT query execute the following statement. 
--If it does return the same number of records the skip to the last step.

SELECT DISTINCT plants.spp_id, plants_tax.spp_id FROM
species_lists.plants
LEFT OUTER JOIN taxonomy.plants_tax
	ON plants.spp_id = plants_tax.spp_id
WHERE plants_tax.spp_id IS NULL;

--This will return the spp_id that are in the species list but not in the taxonomy table. 

--finally return the plants taxonomy table to its original name. 	

ALTER TABLE taxonomy.plants_tax
RENAME TO plants;
