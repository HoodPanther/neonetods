Dear (contact name),
 
My name is XXXX. I am currently working on behalf of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON;neoninc.org). 

A key component of the Observatory is long-term terrestrial sampling throughout the US, including breeding birds, small mammals, plants, carabid beetles and mosquitoes. NEON scientists recognize that existing data concerning species composition and abundance are extremely valuable to the development of site-specific sampling and training protocols. Moreover, NEON endeavors to make efficient use of public resources by attempting to avoid reinventing the wheel and by taking advantage of input and data from the broader scientific community.

To that end, I am contacting you to request these data concerning TAXON or TAXA for SITE X, as well as your data use policy, if applicable. In the near-term, these data will only be used by NEON internally to develop sampling protocols, quality assurance protocols, training materials, and collection permit applications. 

That said, in the longer term, if you and your institution are amenable, NEON envisions incorporating such valuable data into modelling efforts intended to enable continental scaling and forecasting. If you are willing to consider this use of your data, NEON will contact you again prior to such an effort to establish terms of use, if necessary.

Thanks in advance for your assistance. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. I am also happy to put you in touch with the appropriate NEON Scientist, if that is preferable.

Thanks again,
